6900248150125,SAC,Commonmancoffeeroasters,SG AeroPress Championship '22 Tote Bag x 8EyedSpud,23.0,USD,tote bag,"The theme for SGAC '22 is ""Return to Nature"", strengthening our innate connection with the world outside. A fitting reminder that we aren't meant to be holed up indoors and belong to the great outdoors, the perfect AeroPress setting. We've collaborated with local artist 8eyedspud to amplify our vision. Nat and Jackie (the artist duo) combined the essence of the AeroPress Championships with the awkward feeling of returning to a post-pandemic normal, figuring out how to do outdoor… life things. Riffing off Singapore's tropical vibe, a crowd of palm trees look skeptically down at an Aeropress and his adventure squad that's doing their darndest best to fake it till they make it. With makeshift grass skirts and pasted leaves, they're very proud of their handiwork (as they should be!), despite the disparaging looks around. The tote bags are hand-printed by our incredible friends Konstrukt Labs. Available in limited quantities.

7569801576557,Common Man Coffee Roasters,Commonmancoffeeroasters,"Cascara by Finca El Porvenir, Colombia",14.0,USD,Coffee,"Region: Cauca, Popayan Producer: Diego Triana Altitude: 1700 - 1900 MASL Process: Natural Drying Variety: Tabi Tasting Notes: Roselle, Prune, Hawthorn Berry About Finca El Porvenir Cascara begins with the coffee cherry—much more than just the source of our beloved beans. At Finca El Porvenir, once the cherries are depulped, their skin—cascara—is carefully collected and dried, transforming what was once a by-product into something remarkable. Cascara offers a flavour profile all its own: naturally sweet, with notes of dried fruits, florals, and honey. Its light body and gentle acidity make it a refreshing brew, whether steeped hot or cold, with a warm amber hue and flavours true to the essence of the coffee cherry. Finca El Porvenir, overseen by Diego Triana, sits in Colombia’s Cauca region, where volcanic soil and cool mountain air come together at altitudes between 1700 and 1900 metres above sea level.
