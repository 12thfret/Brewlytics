Topics covered include physics of percolation, extraction, and grinding, as well as water chemistry. Jonathan further indulges us with niche topics such as pouring-kettle design, optimizing turbulence while pouring, the impact of fines on percolation, the physics of paper filters, and the geometry of various brewers. Original ideas are presented about coffee brewing and backed up by facts and data. ""The most wonderful thing about The Physics of Filter Coffee is not the impressive depth of the science, but the practical lessons Jonathan draws from the science.
