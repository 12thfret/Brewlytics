This lot is sourced from more than 350 farmers living in the Yirgacheffe, Idido district. Farmers deliver ripe cherries to the Gizat washing station, where they undergo a meticulous sorting process to ensure only the best cherries are selected. These are then immediately placed on raised beds and dried over 15- 20 days. These African raised beds are carefully constructed to ensure proper air circulation and temperature control for optimal, steady drying. Cherries are also turned regularly to prevent damage via over-fermentation and mould growth. The cherries are stored at a local warehouse after their moisture content is recorded at 11.5-12%.
