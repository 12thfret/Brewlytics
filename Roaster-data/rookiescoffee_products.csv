Sidra is a new hybrid coffee variety, made from Bourbon and Typica, and it melds the characteristics of these two varieties. It has acquired the dense sugars and weight of a Red Bourbon and the acidity of Typica. At the farm, you can distinguish them by seeing strong, confident looking trees with dark green leaves and tight nodes of cherries.

Once uniformly ripe cherries arrive at Gemechu station, they are immediately laid out on African drying beds, where they are carefully dried over an average of 22 days. To ensure even drying, the team at Gemechu turns the cherries every hour and covers them with shade between 12–3 PM daily to protect them from direct sunlight. When the cherries reach a moisture level of 10–11%, they are sealed in GrainPro bags to enhance and preserve their aroma. The coffee is then stored in jute bags and rested for a minimum of 45 days before dry milling.

Within the Nyeri County is the Chinga Coffee Factory, belonging to the Othaya Farmers’ Cooperative Society (FCS). In Kenya, factories are essentially wet mills and collection points for coffee. The Cianda Estate was founded in 1928 and is located in Kiambu County, Central Kenya, approximately 25 kilometers north of Nairobi. Situated at roughly 1,795 meters above sea level, the region where the Factory is located is defined by its bright red soils, full of rich nutrients for coffee trees. The high altitude allows for ideal temperatures and rainfall for the slow maturation of coffee cherries. Producers will add manure, compost, coffee pulp and green manure to enrich their soil. After the ripe cherries are harvested by hand, they are delivered to the wet mill located within the Estate.
