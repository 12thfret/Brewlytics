Following the competition, Hario and Tetsu Kasuya collaborated to create a customized V60 Dripper for everyone to use his recipe. Under the supervision of Kasuya, the conventional rib shape of the V60 dripper has been customized. It slows the water down for better extraction of coffee, making it possible to brew stronger coffee even with the same amount of coarse grounds. This allows even beginners to easily reproduce the ""4:6 method"". A new coffee brewing theory created with the concept of ""easily-brewed delicious coffee for everyone."" Divide water into a ratio of 4 to 6. Adjust taste with the first 40% of water and density with the remaining 60%. The point is to use coarse grounds and make the second pour after the water from the first pour completely drips through.

8138631676124,Papa Palheta,Pppcoffee,"Cascara Tea, La Esmeralda",26.0,USD,Merchandise,"Cascara, meaning ‘skin’ or ‘peel’ in Spanish, is the skin of the coffee cherry, which is typically discarded after the cherries are washed and depulped. Once dried, it makes for a unique and refreshing tea. From the Boquete region in Panama, Hacienda La Esmeralda is an award-winning farm run by the Peterson family. Having won the Best of Panama auctions multiple times, La Esmeralda is an estate with a long and rich history. As a family-run business, they pride themselves on high quality coffee that is internationally acclaimed. They were one of the first producers to separate coffee lots by varietals, and in their forward-thinking, their Gesha varietal lot won the 2004 national competition for its juicy brightness and multi-layered aromatics. The fame of the varietal grew and today Gesha varietals are sold for one of the highest prices in coffee's history. With this prized Gesha varietal, La Esmeralda has produced cascara from the skin of the coffee fruit.
