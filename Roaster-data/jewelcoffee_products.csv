Chemex® filters are 20-30% heavier than competitive brands and remove even the finest sediment particles as well as the undesirable oils and fats. The formulation of the filter permits the proper infusion time by regulating the filtration rate - not too slow, not too fast. Good infusion of the coffee grounds (as in brewing and steeping tea) gives coffee a richer flavor while at the same time making possible precise fractional extraction filtering out the undesirable components which make coffee bitter by allowing only the desirable flavor elements of the coffee bean to pass through. The Chemex® filter is folded into a cone shape, exactly as in laboratory techniques. This assures uniform extraction since the water filters through all the grounds on its way to the apex of the cone. The Chemex® filter is guaranteed not to burst under the weight of the liquid during filtration, and not to break when lifting out the grounds. 100 filters per p",out of stock,RM1010,https://jewelcoffee.com/products/chemex-fp-2-unfolded-half-moon-bonded-filters,,,,2021-06-18T15:59:14.000Z,2025-10-05T02:55:32.000Z,2021-06-18T15:59:14.000Z,0.295 kg,https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0556/3079/0844/products/RM1010-CHEMEX3-Cupfilter.jpg,"[""https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0556/3079/0844/products/BondedFIiltersUnfoldedHalfMoon.jpg""]",2.0,,,,,,,,,

Chemex® filters are 20-30% heavier than competitive brands and remove even the finest sediment particles as well as the undesirable oils and fats. The formulation of the filter permits the proper infusion time by regulating the filtration rate - not too slow, not too fast. Good infusion of the coffee grounds (as in brewing and steeping tea) gives coffee a richer flavor while at the same time making possible precise fractional extraction filtering out the undesirable components which make coffee bitter by allowing only the desirable flavor elements of the coffee bean to pass through. The Chemex® filter is folded into a cone shape, exactly as in laboratory techniques. This assures uniform extraction since the water filters through all the grounds on its way to the apex of the cone. The Chemex® filter is guaranteed not to burst under the weight of the liquid during filtration, and not to break when lifting out the grounds. 100 filters per p",out of stock,RM1008,https://jewelcoffee.com/products/chemex-6-cup-filters-100-sheets-box-pre-folded-filter-circle,,,,2021-06-18T15:54:38.000Z,2025-10-05T02:55:33.000Z,2021-06-18T15:54:38.000Z,0.472 kg,https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0556/3079/0844/products/BondedFiltersPre-FoldedCircles2.jpg,"[""https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0556/3079/0844/products/BondedFiltersPre-FoldedCircles.jpg""]",2.0,,,,,,,,,

Coffee has been grown in the Gayo Highlands of Sumatra since 1908 and is well known for its rich and complex flavour. Indonesia has a particular method of processing coffee, known as “wet-hulled”, but more accurately said as “giving basah”. Farmers remove the outer skin of the coffee cherries mechanically using a pulping machine. The beans, still coated with mucilage, are then stored for a day. The mucilage is washed off and the parchment coffee is partially dried for sale, retaining only 30% to 35% of the moisture content. Processors then hull the coffee in semi-wet state, which gives the beans a unique bluish-green appearance. This method reduces acidity and increases body, resulting in a classic Indonesian cup profile.

7939447456001,Jewel Coffee,Jewelcoffee,Ethiopia 250g,15.0,USD,Coffee Beans,"SUBSCRIBE & KEY IN ""JCBAG50"" NOW TO ENJOY 50% OFF! Guji is famous in the coffee-growing region for its rich and volcanic soil. The high altitudes of 1600 - 1700 masl, bi-modal rainfall patterns and dry weather allow coffee to develop slowly and consistently. The coffee comes from smallholder farmers of Hambela Wamena with farms of less than 2.5 hectares and has gone through a natural process. Natural processing refers to drying the cherry together with the coffee - ultimately roasting and brewing causing the sugars and other compounds present in the cherry to ferment together with the seed, evolving into a cup of coffee with notes of floral, peach and strawberry.

Coffee has been grown in the Gayo Highlands of Sumatra since 1908 and is well known for its rich and complex flavour. Indonesia has a particular method of processing coffee, known as “wet-hulled”, but more accurately said as “giving basah”. Farmers remove the outer skin of the coffee cherries mechanically using a pulping machine. The beans, still coated with mucilage, are then stored for a day. The mucilage is washed off and the parchment coffee is partially dried for sale, retaining only 30% to 35% of the moisture content.
