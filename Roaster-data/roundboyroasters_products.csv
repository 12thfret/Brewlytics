The U French Press brews as good as it looks. The 450ml Borosilicate Glass carafe allows you to brew a good volume of coffee for you and a friend, without scalding yourself when kept in its high quality insulating sleeve. Apart from retaining heat, the sleeve is heat resistant, making it easy to handle when brewing. The round boys love how the carafe fits nicely inside the sleeve, and this reduces the chance of accidentally breaking / cracking the glass - we're broken a few french presses unwittingly so this is a plus! Another neat thing about this press is the 0.35mm high density stainless steel mesh that ensures your grounds stay down! The V shaped spout also steadies the pour to minimise spillage.

Fast forward to the V4, it employs a new modular system to attach and remove modular bottoms which was previously not possible to do on he V3. As Orea puts it, “the system was designed to make big changes to the system but with small moving parts.
