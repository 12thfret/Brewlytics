This coffee is harvested following strict ripeness critieria, floated and hand-sorted to remove any defects. Cherries were then exposed to 30hours of underwater fermentation before being pupled. The parchment was then gently washed and then dried in temperature controlled conditions until ideal moisture content was achieved. This microlot is 100% Caturra. This variety originated in Minas Gerai, Brazil. It is a natural mutation of Red Bourbon. Caturra produces more coffee and is more resistant to plant diseases than Bourbon.

This dish usually consists of chicken, tamarind gravy and the fruit of the Pangium plant, Buah Keluak. Asylum Coffeehouse spent 14 months to develop the recipe for roasting and brewing this unique dark blend of coffee. Expect a subtle earthy aroma which opens up to smooth chocolate, a floral hint, and a pleasant lingering of peanuts with a clean short umami finish. The desire to have an espresso that is able to shine even with milk and milk alternatives was the goal when designing Keluak. The result is a delightful medium bodied mouthfeel and a short clean finish.

Recently, the team at April developed a glass version of the April Brewer. Using borosilicate glass, the April Glass Brewer is able to withstand high fluctuation of temperature, making it perfect for brewing coffee. The bottom of the April Brewer features three ""Filter Holder"" wedges that hold your paper filter in place. This elevates the filter and allows a flow rate you cannot achieve with other flat-bed brewers. The result is a perfectly balanced, transparent, and reliable taste experience.
